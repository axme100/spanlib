#The first step is to read in the files as unicode (utf-8) using Python's 
#built-in open() statement to create a file object. Then use the files object's
#associated read() method to creat a list. splitlines() reads each line as an element in
#the list without importing line break characters.

#Open() is embedded in a with-as() statement, among other reasons, so that we don't
#have to close the file. See this website: #http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/with-statement-in-python

#Maybe make a list of lists???!?!?!? Not sure
